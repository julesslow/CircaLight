INITIAL ATTEMPT

We initially planned to follow the DigiKey Track, centering our project around a 
dynamic house lighting system that adjusts indoor lighting based on the amount of sunlight outside.
The goal of this system was to help improve people’s circadian rhythms and promote better life balance.
We attempted to use an Arduino Uno R3 with a Qwiic Shield and a Qwiic human presence sensor. 
However, we encountered compatibility issues with this setup, and the sensor did not function correctly with our board configuration.
After seeking help in the parts room and troubleshooting for approximately thirty minutes, we were advised to pivot our project, 
as Qwiic-based equipment was required to properly complete the DigiKey track.


PIVOTING

Because our project still focused on improving health and life balance through circadian rhythm regulation, 
we decided to pursue the Intermediate Healthcare Track instead. Additionally, since we could no longer use the 
dollhouse provided by the DigiKey track, we chose to laser cut our own house structure.
For the revised design, we continued using an Arduino Uno R3, but replaced the Qwiic sensor with ultrasonic-
sensors to detect movement and photoresistors to measure ambient light levels. We soldered the LED strips, photoresistors, 
and ultrasonic sensors to complete the hardware setup for our system.
