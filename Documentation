# INITIAL ATTEMPT

We started with the intent to follow the DigiKey Track, with our project centered around
a dynamic house lighting system based on the amount of sunlight outside. 
The purpose was to help improve peoples circadian rythm and improve life balance. 

We tried using a Audrino Uno R3 Board with a Qwiic Shield. However, when we tried using the Qwiic human presence sensor,
it did not work with the board set up. We tried getting help by doing to the parts room but after they tried helping us for
about half an hour, they adviced us to pivot since Qwiic equipment was required for the DigiKey track.

# PIVOTING 

Since our project helped improve life balance by improving ones circadian rythm, we decied to pursue
the intermediate, Healthcare track. Since we could also not use the doll house from the DigiKey track, we decided to 
lazer cut our own house. 

We still chose to use a Audrino Uno R3 board, with ultrasound sensors as movement sensors and photo resistors as light sensors. 
We sautred our LED strips, our photo resistors and our ultrasound sensors.
