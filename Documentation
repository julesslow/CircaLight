## INITIAL ATTEMPT

We initially planned to follow the DigiKey Track, centering our project around a dynamic house lighting system 
that adjusts indoor lighting based on the amount of sunlight outside. The goal of this system was to help improve 
people’s circadian rhythms and promote better life balance. We attempted to use an Arduino Uno R3 with a Qwiic Shield 
and a Qwiic human presence sensor. However, we encountered compatibility issues with this setup, and the sensor did not
function correctly with our board configuration. After seeking help in the parts room and troubleshooting for approximately
thirty minutes, we were advised to pivot our project, as Qwiic-based equipment was required to properly complete the DigiKey track.



## PIVOTING

Because our project still focused on improving health and life balance through circadian rhythm regulation, 
we decided to pursue the Intermediate Healthcare Track instead. Additionally, since we could no longer use 
the dollhouse provided by the DigiKey track, we chose to laser cut our own house structure. For the revised 
design, we continued using an Arduino Uno R3, but replaced the Qwiic sensor with ultrasonic distance sensors 
to detect presence and photoresistors to measure ambient light levels. We soldered the LED strips, photoresistors, 
and ultrasonic sensors to complete the hardware setup for our system.



## PROCEDURE AND ITERATIVE DEVELOPMENT

### LED Strip Assembly and Layout Changes

Initially, we soldered approximately eight short LED strips together, each consisting of three LEDs cut from a 
circular LED strip. When we attempted to test this configuration using the Arduino, the LEDs no longer turned on. 
We concluded that this issue was most likely caused by faulty soldering connections or excessive stress on the LED pads during assembly.

To address this, we redesigned the lighting layout to be simpler and more reliable. Instead of multiple small segments, 
we reduced the system to two longer LED strips placed along the edges of the two rooms in the house model. These strips 
were carefully soldered and tested individually before being integrated, which significantly improved reliability and made debugging easier.



### Distance Sensor Placement and Behavior Tuning

While working on the ultrasonic distance sensor, we decided to mount it directly in front of the door of the house. 
This placement allowed the sensor to more accurately detect when someone entered or exited the space. However, achieving 
correct behavior required multiple iterations of code adjustments.

We refined the logic used to interpret distance readings so the system could distinguish between the door being briefly 
opened versus someone actually entering the room. Through repeated testing, we were able to correctly detect when the door 
remained open or closed long enough to indicate occupancy, allowing the lights to turn on when someone entered and turn off 
when the space was vacant.



### Photoresistor Calibration and Gradual Brightness Control

During testing, we noticed that the LED brightness changes in response to the photoresistor readings were either too abrupt
or not visually noticeable. To solve this issue, we implemented a calibration strategy that divided photoresistor readings into defined ranges.

Each range of ambient light values was mapped to a corresponding LED brightness level. This approach allowed the lights
to adjust more smoothly and gradually as outdoor light conditions changed, creating a more natural and comfortable indoor
lighting experience that better aligned with circadian rhythm goals.



### Final Integration and Power Considerations

At the current stage, we are integrating the complete system into the laser-cut house structure. During this process, 
we evaluated different power options for the Arduino and components. We determined that powering the board directly from 
a computer via USB was the most stable and reliable option. Battery power proved inconsistent, as some configurations 
supplied too little voltage while others risked supplying too much, leading to unreliable behavior.

Using a computer-based power source ensured consistent voltage delivery and allowed for easier testing and debugging
as we finalized the physical assembly of the system.



## CURRENT STATUS

The system now successfully integrates LED lighting, a photoresistor for ambient light detection, 
and an ultrasonic distance sensor for occupancy detection within the laser-cut house. Ongoing work focuses on final physical assembly,
wire management, and refining thresholds to further improve reliability and responsiveness.

## LESSONS LEARNED

This project reinforced the importance of isolating operations when building and debugging hardware systems, as testing individual 
components made it easier to identify issues. We also learned to always connect power and ground first to ensure stable behavior and 
avoid electrical problems. Finally, the experience highlighted the value of being flexible and willing to pivot when an initial approach 
does not work, allowing progress toward the overall project goal.
