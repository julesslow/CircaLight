# INITIAL ATTEMPT

We started with the intent to follow the DigiKey Track, without our project centered around a dynamic house lighting system based on the amount of sunlight outside. 
The purpose was to help improve peoples circadian rythm and improve life balance. 

We tried using a Audrino Uno R3 Board with a Qwiic Shield.
